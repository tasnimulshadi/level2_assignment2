# Level 2 Assignment 2

## Objective

Develop a Node.js Express application with TypeScript as the programming language, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose for user data and order management. Ensure data integrity through validation using Joi/Zod.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before running the application locally:

- Node.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-express-app.git](https://github.com/Apollo-Level2-Web-Dev/L2-B2-assignment-2.git)
    ```

2. Change into the project's directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-express-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

If your Express application requires configuration, provide information on how to set up environment variables or configuration files.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

    ```
    NODE_ENV = development
    PORT = 3000
    DATABASE_URL = 
    BCRYPY_SALT_ROUNDS=12
    ```

   Customize the values according to your needs.

## Running the Application

Start the Express application using the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
